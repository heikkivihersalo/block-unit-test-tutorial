# Repository for Block Unit Test article

This is an repository for the article about handling unit tests in native Gutenberg Blocks. [You can find the article here.](https://www.kotisivu.dev/gutenberg-lohkojen-yksikkotestauksesta/).

In short, writing unit and integration tests is incredibly powerful tool and is often NOT discussed in block development. However I believe it should be better integrated to the block development experience. I will be using this on my own projects and you can copy, modify and make your own version from the boilerplate above.

I truly hope you find this helpful even though the setup is very simple (luckily).
